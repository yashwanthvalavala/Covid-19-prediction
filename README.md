COVID-19 Prediction Using Chest X-rays
This project aims to predict COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is built using deep learning techniques and utilizes the TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries to achieve high accuracy.

Overview
Chest X-rays can reveal signs of pneumonia or other respiratory conditions. In this project, we leverage CNNs to analyze X-ray images and predict the likelihood of COVID-19 infection. The model was trained using labeled datasets consisting of chest X-rays from COVID-19 positive and negative patients.

Features
Chest X-ray image input for the model.
CNN-based architecture for accurate image classification.
TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries used for model development and training.
Data preprocessing for image normalization and augmentation.
Algorithms Used
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
CNNs are designed to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images. The layers in CNNs (convolutional, pooling, dense, etc.) are responsible for learning and detecting patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes in chest X-ray images.

Key Layers in CNN:
Convolutional Layers: Apply filters to input images to detect features.
Pooling Layers: Downsample the image to reduce dimensionality.
Fully Connected Layers: Perform the final classification based on extracted features.
Libraries Used
TensorFlow: Open-source deep learning framework for building and training CNN models.
PyTorch: Another popular deep learning framework used for model development and experimentation.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how deep learning models, particularly CNNs, can be applied to medical image analysis to predict COVID-19 from chest X-rays. The model can be further enhanced with techniques such as data augmentation, model tuning, and transfer learning.

Future Work
Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG to enhance performance.
Multi-class Classification: Classify not only COVID-19 but also other types of pneumonia or normal images.
Real-time Prediction: Deploy the model for real-time predictions using a web application.
